**Note:** Replace ```Matthew Daly``` ```matthewbdaly``` ```https://matthewdaly.co.uk``` ```450801+matthewbdaly@users.noreply.github.com``` ```publishing-kit``` ```http-proxy``` ```PSR7-compliant HTTP caching proxy``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line. You can run `$ php prefill.php` in the command line to make all replacements at once. Delete the file prefill.php as well.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
